My name is <b>Stefano Martina</b>, I am a
<a href="http://smartcomputing.unifi.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Computing</a> PHD student at
<a href="https://www.unifi.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Florence</a>. I am member of the
<a href="http://ai.dinfo.unifi.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artificial Intelligence group</a>.

I have an eclectic approach to research. I try to view things from different perspectives. My research interests are related to machine learning applied to medical data. In detail I work with recursive neural networks in the context of structural learning. In the past I worked at CERN where I implemented a small part of a software for the development of CMS tracker geometry.
