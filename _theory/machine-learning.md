*Machine Learning* (ML) is a branch of *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) where the focus is to develop systems that learn from the data. Machine Learning is a field that is located in the intersection of different disciplines:
- *Statistics* deal with the uncertainty of the world and, as we will see, ML can be framed as a probability estimation;
- *Data Science* is the science that interpretes and study the information contained in the data and how can be used;
- *Optimization Theory* is the mathematical branch that define methods to optimize functions, ML can be seen as an optimization problem;
- *Computer Science* is the science that studies algorithms and their complexity;
- *Computer Engineering* focuses in the development of efficient software.

In order to learn we must provide some data. The data can be of different kinds. We can denote three different types of ML based on the type of data and problem that we need to resolve.

## Supervised learning ##
In supervised learning we posses a dataset composed of pairs:
\begin{equation}
	(\vec{x}_1,\vec{y}_1), \dots, (\vec{x}_N,\vec{y}_N)
\end{equation}

## Reinforcement learning ##

## Unsupervised learning ##
